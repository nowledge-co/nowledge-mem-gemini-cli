# Changelog

All notable changes to the Nowledge Mem Gemini CLI extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-23

### Changed

- Search-memory skill: renamed "Strong Triggers" → "Strong Signals" and added "Contextual signals" section (debugging, architecture, conventions) — aligned with shared behavioral guidance across all Nowledge Mem integrations
- Distill-memory skill: strengthened proactive save guidance ("Save proactively... Do not wait to be asked")

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-10

### Changed

- Added a committed Gemini extension mirror at the `community` repository root so gallery crawlers can discover a valid root-level manifest and install surface
- Added release tooling that refreshes and validates the repo-root mirror before packaging

### Fixed

- Closed the remaining gallery-indexing risk where the extension manifest previously lived only inside the `nowledge-mem-gemini-cli/` subdirectory

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-10

### Changed

- Hardened the Gemini release packaging flow so the shipped archive better matches what the marketplace crawler expects from a clean extension bundle
- Refined release instructions to explicitly call out archive verification for macOS metadata drift before publishing

### Fixed

- Prevented macOS AppleDouble metadata entries such as `._README.md` from being emitted into the release archive
- Added archive verification that fails packaging if hidden metadata files still appear in the generated `.tar.gz`

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-09

### Changed

- Clarified the remote-mode contract so real thread save is explicitly described as client-side transcript capture through `nmem`, not server-side filesystem access
- Sharpened release readiness around hook validation, release packaging, and user-facing documentation for the marketplace path
- Polished command, skill, README, website, and lifecycle wording so Working Memory, routed recall, real thread save, distillation, and handoff summaries present one coherent product model

### Fixed

- Corrected the Gemini hook schema to use the top-level `hooks` object Gemini expects during extension linking
- Ensured `save-handoff` remains the resumable-summary surface while `save-thread` remains reserved for the real Gemini transcript importer

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- Initial Gemini CLI extension for Nowledge Mem
- Persistent `GEMINI.md` context for working memory, search, distillation, thread-save, and handoff behavior
- Six custom commands: read working memory, search memory, distill memory, save thread, save handoff, and status
- Five agent skills: `read-working-memory`, `search-memory`, `distill-memory`, `save-thread`, and `save-handoff`
- Native Gemini thread-save guidance built around `nmem t save --from gemini-cli`
- Support for `NMEM_API_URL` and `NMEM_API_KEY` shell-level overrides alongside durable `nmem` config-file setup
- CLI-first remote setup guidance built around `~/.nowledge-mem/config.json`
- Release packaging, checksum generation, and GitHub Actions automation for tagged Gemini extension releases
- Release documentation and versioned release notes for reproducible Gemini marketplace publishing
- Native Gemini extension hooks for Working Memory bootstrap at session start and best-effort thread import at session end

### Changed

- Tightened the Gemini manifest to better match Gemini CLI extension reference guidance, including a gallery-facing description field
- Improved search, distillation, thread-save, and handoff prompts to prefer stronger `nmem` patterns like JSON mode, `--mode deep`, `--unit-type`, labels, and `-s gemini-cli`
- Corrected Gemini save semantics by restoring `save-thread` for real session import and keeping `save-handoff` as the distinct resumable-summary action
- Refined handoff guidance around a structured summary format with Goal, Decisions, Files, Risks, and Next
- Fixed collapsed multiline command examples in the Gemini skills so the shipped prompts and docs stay clear and copyable
- Clarified same-machine desktop setup, local-default status expectations, Working Memory empty-state behavior, Gemini install UX for local users, and the cross-agent memory lifecycle contract
